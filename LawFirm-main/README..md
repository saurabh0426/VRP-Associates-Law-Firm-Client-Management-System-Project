# VRP Associates Law Firm - AI-Powered Case & Document Management System

## üåü Overview
This project is an advanced web application designed to streamline case management, client interaction, and document analysis for VRP Associates Law Firm. It utilizes a modern **Firebase-integrated frontend** for secure user authentication and a powerful **Python/Flask backend** to leverage **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for automated legal document processing.

---

## üöÄ Key Features

### Frontend (Client & Lawyer Portals)
* **Secure Authentication:** Separate registration flows for **Clients** (`newUser.html`) and **Lawyers** (`newLawyer.html`) using Firebase Authentication.
* **Dashboard Views:** Dedicated dashboards for clients and lawyers to view case summaries and system statistics.
* **Case & Document Management:** Allows clients to upload documents with **drag-and-drop** functionality (`cases.html`), rename, and delete files securely via Firebase Storage.
* **Appointments:** Management and scheduling of client-lawyer appointments (`appointments.html`).
* **Profile Management:** Functionality for users and lawyers to update their personal and professional details (`profile.html`).

### Backend (AI/NLP Service)
* **OCR Processing:** Uses **`pytesseract`** to accurately extract text from uploaded images and PDF legal documents.
* **Advanced NLP:** Applies **`spaCy`** and **`TextBlob`** to the extracted text to provide:
    * **Summarization**
    * **Sentiment Analysis**
    * **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** (e.g., identifying names, dates, organizations in legal text).
* **Chatbot Integration:** Includes a front-end interface (`chatBot.html`) for an OCR-aware chatbot, likely designed to query and retrieve information directly from the analyzed documents.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your development machine:

1.  **Python 3.8+**
2.  **pip** (Python package installer)
3.  **Tesseract OCR Engine:** The Tesseract executable must be installed on your system.
    * **Windows:** Download the installer and ensure the path to `tesseract.exe` is configured in `app.py`.
    * **Linux/macOS:** Install via package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install tesseract-ocr`).
4.  **Firebase Project:** A configured Firebase project with **Authentication**, **Firestore**, and **Cloud Storage** enabled.

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### 1. Backend (Python/Flask) Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>
    cd <project-root-folder>
    ```

2.  **Create a Python Virtual Environment and activate it:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # A complete list of dependencies should be placed in a requirements.txt file.
    # If no requirements.txt exists, run:
    pip install Flask Flask-CORS pytesseract spacy textblob Pillow numpy pdf2image
    ```

4.  **Download spaCy Model:**
    ```bash
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    ```

5.  **Update Tesseract Path:**
    If using Windows, you must update the path in `app.py`:
    ```python
    # Inside app.py
    pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r"C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe" # <--- UPDATE THIS
    ```

### 2. Frontend (HTML/JS) Configuration

You must replace the placeholder Firebase configuration with your actual project credentials in all HTML files that initialize Firebase (e.g., `index.html`, `logout.html`, `chatBot.html`, etc.).

**Configuration Snippet:**
```javascript
// Inside your HTML files, update the firebaseConfig object:
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE", 
    authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN_HERE", 
    projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID_HERE",
    // ... rest of your project keys
};
‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Application
1. Start the Backend Service
Ensure your virtual environment is active and run the Flask application:

Bash

python app.py
The service will start, typically running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

2. Launch the Frontend
Open the index.html file directly in your web browser.

Use the Login/Registration pages to sign up as a new lawyer or client.

Navigate to cases.html to test file upload and document analysis features.

Use uploadFile.html for a dedicated, raw test of the OCR/NLP backend service.
